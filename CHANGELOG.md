## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **QMD Backend Support**: Optional QMD (Query Memory Daemon) backend for hybrid search with BM25 + vector + LLM reranking
  - Gated behind `qmd` feature flag (enabled by default)
  - Web UI shows installation instructions and QMD status
  - Comparison table between built-in SQLite and QMD backends
- **Citations**: Configurable citation mode (on/off/auto) for memory search results
  - Auto mode includes citations when results span multiple files
- **Session Export**: Option to export session transcripts to memory for future reference
- **LLM Reranking**: Use LLM to rerank search results for improved relevance (requires QMD)
- **Memory Documentation**: Added `docs/src/memory.md` with comprehensive memory system documentation

- **Mobile PWA Support**: Install moltis as a Progressive Web App on iOS, Android, and desktop
  - Standalone mode with full-screen experience
  - Custom app icon (crab mascot)
  - Service worker for offline support and caching
  - Safe area support for notched devices

- **Push Notifications**: Receive alerts when the LLM responds
  - VAPID key generation and storage for Web Push API
  - Subscribe/unsubscribe toggle in Settings > Notifications
  - Subscription management UI showing device name, IP address, and date
  - Remove any subscription from any device
  - Real-time subscription updates via WebSocket
  - Client IP detection from X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, CF-Connecting-IP headers
  - Notifications sent for both streaming and agent (tool-using) chat modes

- **Safari/iOS PWA Detection**: Show "Add to Dock" instructions when push notifications
  require PWA installation (Safari doesn't support push in browser mode)

- **Session state store**: per-session key-value persistence scoped by
  namespace, backed by SQLite (`session_state` tool).
- **Session branching**: `branch_session` tool forks a conversation at any
  message index into an independent copy.
- **Session fork from UI**: Fork button in the chat header and sidebar action
  buttons let users fork sessions without asking the LLM. Forked sessions
  appear indented under their parent with a branch icon.
- **Skill self-extension**: `create_skill`, `update_skill`, `delete_skill`
  tools let the agent manage project-local skills at runtime.
- **Skill hot-reload**: filesystem watcher on skill directories emits
  `skills.changed` events via WebSocket when SKILL.md files change.
- **Typed tool sources**: `ToolSource` enum (`Builtin` / `Mcp { server }`)
  replaces string-prefix identification of MCP tools in the tool registry.
- **Tool registry metadata**: `list_schemas()` now includes `source` and
  `mcpServer` fields so the UI can group tools by origin.
- **Per-session MCP toggle**: sessions store an `mcp_disabled` flag; the chat
  header exposes a toggle button to enable/disable MCP tools per session.
- **Debug panel convergence**: the debug side-panel now renders the same seven
  sections as the `/context` slash command, eliminating duplicated rendering
  logic.
- Documentation pages for session state, session branching, skill
  self-extension, and the tool registry architecture.

### Changed

- Memory settings UI enhanced with backend comparison and feature explanations
- Added `memory.qmd.status` RPC method for checking QMD availability
- Extended `memory.config.get` to include `qmd_feature_enabled` flag

- Push notifications feature is now enabled by default in the CLI

- **TLS HTTP redirect port** now defaults to `gateway_port + 1` instead of
  the hardcoded port `18790`. This makes the Dockerfile simpler (both ports
  are adjacent) and avoids collisions when running multiple instances.
  Override via `[tls] http_redirect_port` in `moltis.toml` or the
  `MOLTIS_TLS__HTTP_REDIRECT_PORT` environment variable.

- **TLS certificates use `moltis.localhost` domain.** Auto-generated server
  certs now include `moltis.localhost`, `*.moltis.localhost`, `localhost`,
  `127.0.0.1`, and `::1` as SANs. Banner and redirect URLs use
  `https://moltis.localhost:<port>` when bound to loopback, so the cert
  matches the displayed URL. Existing certs are automatically regenerated
  on next startup.

- **Certificate validity uses dynamic dates.** Cert `notBefore`/`notAfter`
  are now computed from the current system time instead of being hardcoded.
  CA certs are valid for 10 years, server certs for 1 year from generation.

- `McpToolBridge` now stores and exposes `server_name()` for typed
  registration.
- `mcp_service::sync_mcp_tools()` uses `unregister_mcp()` /
  `register_mcp()` instead of scanning tool names by prefix.
- `chat.rs` uses `clone_without_mcp()` instead of
  `clone_without_prefix("mcp__")` in all three call sites.

### Fixed

- Push notifications not sending when chat uses agent mode (run_with_tools)
- Missing space in Safari install instructions ("usingFile" → "using File")
- **WebSocket origin validation** now treats `.localhost` subdomains
  (e.g. `moltis.localhost`) as loopback equivalents per RFC 6761.
- Fork/branch icon in session sidebar now renders cleanly at 16px (replaced
  complex git-branch SVG with simple trunk+branch path).
- Deleting a forked session now navigates to the parent session instead of
  an unrelated sibling.
- **Streaming tool calls for non-Anthropic providers**: `OpenAiProvider`,
  `GitHubCopilotProvider`, `KimiCodeProvider`, `OpenAiCodexProvider`, and
  `ProviderChain` now implement `stream_with_tools()` so tool schemas are
  sent in the streaming API request and tool-call events are properly parsed.
  Previously only `AnthropicProvider` supported streaming tool calls; all
  other providers silently dropped the tools parameter, causing the LLM to
  emit tool invocations as plain text instead of structured function calls.
- **Streaming tool call arguments dropped when index ≠ 0**: When a provider
  (e.g. GitHub Copilot proxying Claude) emits a text content block at
  streaming index 0 and a tool_use block at index 1, the runner's argument
  finalization used the streaming index as the vector position directly.
  Since `tool_calls` has only 1 element at position 0, the condition
  `1 < 1` was false and arguments were silently dropped (empty `{}`).
  Fixed by mapping streaming indices to vector positions via a HashMap.
- **Skill tools wrote to wrong directory**: `create_skill`, `update_skill`, and
  `delete_skill` used `std::env::current_dir()` captured at gateway startup,
  writing skills to `<cwd>/.moltis/skills/` instead of `~/.moltis/skills/`.
  Skills now write to `<data_dir>/skills/` (Personal source), which is always
  discovered regardless of where the gateway was started.
- **Skills page missing personal/project skills**: The `/api/skills` endpoint
  only returned manifest-based registry skills. Personal and project-local
  skills were never shown in the navigation or skills page. The endpoint now
  discovers and includes them alongside registry skills.

### Documentation

- Added mobile-pwa.md with PWA installation and push notification documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md with cargo feature policy (features enabled by default)
- Rewrote session-branching.md with accurate fork details, UI methods, RPC
  API, inheritance table, and deletion behavior.
