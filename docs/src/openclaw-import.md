# OpenClaw Import

Moltis can automatically detect and import data from an existing [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai) installation. This lets you migrate to Moltis without losing your provider keys, memory files, skills, sessions, or channel configuration.

## How Detection Works

Moltis checks for an OpenClaw installation in two locations:

1. The path set in the `OPENCLAW_HOME` environment variable
2. `~/.openclaw/` (default)

If the directory exists and contains recognizable OpenClaw files (`openclaw.json`, agent directories, etc.), Moltis considers it detected. The workspace directory respects the `OPENCLAW_PROFILE` environment variable for multi-profile setups.

## What Gets Imported

| Category | Source | Destination | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Identity** | `openclaw.json` agent name and timezone | `moltis.toml` identity section | Preserves existing Moltis identity if already configured |
| **Providers** | Agent auth-profiles (API keys) | `~/.moltis/provider_keys.json` | Maps OpenClaw provider names to Moltis equivalents (e.g., `google` becomes `gemini`) |
| **Skills** | `skills/` directories with `SKILL.md` | `~/.moltis/skills/` | Copies entire skill directories; skips duplicates |
| **Memory** | `MEMORY.md` and `memory/*.md` daily logs | `~/.moltis/MEMORY.md` and `~/.moltis/memory/` | Appends with `<!-- Imported from OpenClaw -->` separator for idempotency |
| **Channels** | Telegram bot configuration in `openclaw.json` | `moltis.toml` channels section | Supports both flat and multi-account Telegram configs |
| **Sessions** | JSONL conversation files under `agents/*/sessions/` | `~/.moltis/sessions/` | Converts OpenClaw message format to Moltis format; prefixes keys with `oc:` |
| **MCP Servers** | `mcp-servers.json` | `~/.moltis/mcp-servers.json` | Merges with existing servers; skips duplicates by name |

## Importing via Web UI

### During Onboarding

If Moltis detects an OpenClaw installation at first launch, an **Import** step appears in the onboarding wizard before the identity and provider steps. You can select which categories to import using checkboxes, then proceed with the rest of setup.

### From Settings

1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon)
2. Select **OpenClaw Import** from the sidebar
3. Click **Scan** to see what data is available
4. Check the categories you want to import
5. Click **Import Selected**

The import section only appears when an OpenClaw installation is detected.

## Importing via CLI

The `moltis import` command provides three subcommands:

### Detect

Check whether an OpenClaw installation exists and preview what can be imported:

```bash
moltis import detect
```

Example output:

```
OpenClaw installation detected at /Users/you/.openclaw

  Identity:      available (agent: "friday")
  Providers:     available (2 auth profiles)
  Skills:        3 skills found
  Memory:        available (MEMORY.md + 12 daily logs)
  Channels:      available (1 Telegram account)
  Sessions:      47 session files across 2 agents
  MCP Servers:   4 servers configured
```

Use `--json` for machine-readable output:

```bash
moltis import detect --json
```

### Import All

Import everything at once:

```bash
moltis import all
```

Preview what would happen without writing anything:

```bash
moltis import all --dry-run
```

### Import Selected Categories

Import only specific categories:

```bash
moltis import select -c providers,skills,memory
```

Valid category names: `identity`, `providers`, `skills`, `memory`, `channels`, `sessions`, `mcp_servers`.

Combine with `--dry-run` to preview:

```bash
moltis import select -c sessions --dry-run
```

## Importing via RPC

Three RPC methods are available for programmatic access:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `openclaw.detect` | Returns detection and scan results (what data is available) |
| `openclaw.scan` | Alias for `openclaw.detect` |
| `openclaw.import` | Performs the import with a selection object |

Example `openclaw.import` params:

```json
{
  "identity": true,
  "providers": true,
  "skills": true,
  "memory": true,
  "channels": false,
  "sessions": false,
  "mcp_servers": true
}
```

The response includes a report with per-category status (`imported`, `skipped`, `error`) and counts.

## Idempotency

Running the import multiple times is safe:

- **Memory** uses an `<!-- Imported from OpenClaw -->` marker to avoid duplicating content
- **Skills** skip directories that already exist in the Moltis skills folder
- **MCP servers** skip entries with matching names
- **Sessions** use `oc:` prefixed keys that won't collide with native Moltis sessions
- **Provider keys** merge with existing keys without overwriting

## Provider Name Mapping

OpenClaw and Moltis use different names for some providers:

| OpenClaw Name | Moltis Name |
|---------------|-------------|
| `google` | `gemini` |
| `anthropic` | `anthropic` |
| `openai` | `openai` |
| `openrouter` | `openrouter` |

Unmapped provider names are passed through as-is.

## Unsupported Channels

Currently only Telegram channels are imported. If your OpenClaw configuration includes other channel types (Slack, Discord, etc.), they will appear as warnings in the scan output but will not be imported.

## Troubleshooting

### Import not detected

- Verify the OpenClaw directory exists: `ls ~/.openclaw/`
- If using a custom path, set `OPENCLAW_HOME=/path/to/openclaw`
- If using profiles, set `OPENCLAW_PROFILE=your-profile`

### Provider keys not working after import

OpenClaw stores API keys in agent auth-profiles. If the key was rotated or expired in OpenClaw, the imported key will also be invalid. Re-enter the key in **Settings** > **Providers**.

### Memory import appears incomplete

The import only brings over `MEMORY.md` and files matching the daily log pattern (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`) from the `memory/` directory. Other files in the memory directory are not imported.
